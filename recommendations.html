Right on the water, you can enjoy the breeze with one of the best sunset spots on the island. Reasonably priced, rarely a wait, perfect place to walk along the water before or after a meal. You can often see turtles and sting rays from the beach, too.</p>

On the tables they have Mauka Mustard and Hawaiian Fire Sauce, sure to add zing to sandwiches and fries. Try their Cajun pasta or jambalaya for a bit of spice. You can also order their sauces online, to share with friends and family back home. Browse the Kealakekua shops, including the <a href="https://donkeyballstore.com/" target="_blank">Donkey Balls store</a> for some chocolate-covered macadamia nuts.</p>

                                        <p>Prepare yourself for a lengthy drive, but one worth it with the lava flowing right now. Take the highway around the south side of the island. On the way, have breakfast at The Coffee Shack. Don't miss a chance to drive to the southernmost tip of the USA, at <a href="https://www.hawaii.com/big-island/attractions/south-point/" target="_blank">South Point</a> (signs exist). For those brave enough, jump off the cliff into the ocean. Grab some macademia nuts from <a href="https://paradisemeadows.com/" target="_blank">Paradise Meadows</a> on your way back to the highway - they also have restrooms. Other stops to make: <a href="https://www.bakeshophawaii.com/" target="_blank">Panulu'u Bake Shop</a> and <a href="https://volcanowinery.com/" target="_blank">Volcano Winery</a>. Enjoy a meal at <a href="https://www.lavalodge.com/thai-thai-bistro.html" target="_blank">Thai Thai Bistro</a>, then head down to the volcano. A few notes: fill up the vehicle before you head out, bring plenty of water and don't forget flashlights. The volcano walk is not lit and not very level. We recommend the couple-mile trek only for those who can safely navigate rough terrain in the dark.</p>

At the base of the cliffs is the Wailoa Stream: cool, fresh water that meets the ocean waves. Hikers can explore the area for views of waterfalls (Ipu'u, Kakeha and Hi'ilawe, among others) and the ocean from elevation points. Stop for a bite or to shop in the nearby town on Honoka'a.</p>
